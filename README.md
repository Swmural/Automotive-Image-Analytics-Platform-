# 🚗 CarQ - Automated Image Analysis System  
**Created & Maintained by Swathi Muralinathan**

## 💡 Overview
Welcome to the **CarQ** project!  
CarQ is a smart application that combines **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze car images. It identifies the car type, evaluates damage severity, and generates human-readable descriptions — all from a single image upload. CarQ empowers users with instant, data-rich insights into vehicles.
